ID Austria is a unified authentication system that enables citizens to securely access both government and private services online.
It serves as a modern digital identity solution that can be integrated easily alongside other authentication methods of well-known federated identity providers.

### Key Features
- Provides seamless authentication for Austrian citizens (formerly known as Handy-Signatur/BÃ¼rgerkarte)
- Supports EU Login (eIDAS) for users with foreign eIDs
- Uses modern security standards with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Can be integrated into both web and mobile applications

### HowTo
This little technical demo implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow for ID Austria as described [here](https://eid.egiz.gv.at/anbindung/direkte-anbindung/anbindung-oidc/).
It uses the publicly available [test system](https://eid.egiz.gv.at/anbindung/testidentitaeten/)
with a preconfigured [private service provider](https://eid.egiz.gv.at/anbindung/registrierung/registrierung-von-privaten-service-providern/).

1. Choose one of the predefined [test-identities](https://eid.egiz.gv.at/anbindung/testidentitaeten/vordefinierte-testidentitaeten/).
2. Login with the "ID Austria" button.
3. Enter the test-identity's credentials.
4. Upon successful authentication/authorization, you will be redirected back to this app.
5. Browse all the information available from the ID Austria identity provider.
