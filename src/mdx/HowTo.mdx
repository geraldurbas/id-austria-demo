ID Austria is Austria's unified digital identity system that enables citizens to securely access both government and private services online.
It replaces the legacy Handy-Signatur/Bürgerkarte system with a modern authentication solution based on OpenID Connect (OIDC).

### Key Features
- 🔐 Secure authentication for Austrian citizens and residents
- 🇪🇺 EU Login (eIDAS) support for foreign digital identities
- 📱 Works seamlessly on web and mobile applications
- 🛡️ Modern security with OpenID Connect protocol

### How This Demo Works
This application demonstrates the OIDC authentication flow with ID Austria's test environment:

1. **Click "ID Austria"** - Start the authentication process
2. **Choose a test identity** - Use one of the [predefined test accounts](https://www.id-austria.gv.at/de/developer/testen/vordefinierte-testidentit%C3%A4ten)
3. **Enter credentials** - Login with the test identity's username and password
4. **Authorization** - Grant permission for this app to access your identity data
5. **Explore the JWT** - View all claims and data returned by ID Austria

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a proof-of-concept demonstration with no guarantees given, not intended for production use.
The demo exclusively uses ID Austria's test system with synthetic test data. It does not work with real ID Austria accounts or handle any production data. All authentication happens on ID Austria's secure servers using their official OIDC endpoints and JWKS for token verification.
